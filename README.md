# This repo is about code that I learn about nerual network for make graduation project. You'll see file "test_nn_hidden_by_scale_image3" and "test_nn_hidden_by_scale_image3" be the complete code for my project. The "test_nn_hidden_by_scale_image3" and "test_nn_hidden_by_scale_image4" is about extract feature by divide channel then get value from it (get gray value and color value).After that send value to neural network.
